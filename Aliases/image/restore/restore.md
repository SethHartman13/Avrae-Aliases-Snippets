<h1>Image Alias<img align="right" src="image.png" width="100px"></h1>

Subalias that handles restoring images from user's backup library.

## Owner(s):
- Me (ShadowsStride)

# Current Plans:
- None

## Help:
`!image restore`

In order to run this properly, you need to do the following:
- `!image remove [image name]`, `!image update [image name] [image url]`, or `!image rename [old image name] [new image name]` needs to be ran before this can work.

If you want to undo the restoration, simply run `!image restore` again.
