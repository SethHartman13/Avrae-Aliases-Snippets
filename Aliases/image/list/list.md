# Current Plans:

## Help:
`!image list`

In order to run this properly, you need to do the following:
- Run `!image add [image name] [image url]`, see [add](https://github.com/SethHartman13/Avrae-Aliases-Snippets/blob/master/Aliases/image/add/add.md) subalias for additional information. If you do not, then it will throw an error.
