<h1>Image Alias<img align="right" src="./list/canvas.png" width="100px"></h1>

Image alias that handles storing and viewing user images.

## Owner(s):
- Me (ShadowsStride)

# Current Plans:
- None

## Help:
`!image [image name] [image url]`

In order to run this properly, you need to do the following:
- Run `!image add [image name] [image url]`, see [add](https://github.com/SethHartman13/Avrae-Aliases-Snippets/blob/master/Aliases/image/add/add.md) subalias for additional information. If you do not, then it will throw an error.

If your are having problems displaying your image, verify that the image url ends in a .png, .jpeg, .jpg, etc.
