Subalias that allows players to restore a cleared (uncompleted) item 

## Owner(s):
- Seth Hartman (ShadowsStride)

## Help:
`!craft restore`

If the pro-rate refund is turned on, the subalias will attempt to withdraw funds from the character's coin purse that had. If it is unable to do such, then it will not allow the player to restore the item. It also will not allow the player to restore an item that was completed.
