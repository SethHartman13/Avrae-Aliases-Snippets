# User Guide

Welcome to the user guide used to create guides of your own (and guides that shared through gvars).

## JSON Structure

The guide alias's data is organized into different guides within `guide_dict`, each containing specific sections. Here's how the information is structured:

```json
{
    "Guide 1": {
        "Section 1": "Some singular paragraph (does not have a caption)",
        "Section 2": {
            "Header": "Header paragraph of heading 2 (does not have a caption, optional)",
            "Sub-section 1": "Contents of sub-section 1",
            "Sub-section 2": "Contents of sub-section 2",
            "Sub-section 3": "Contents of sub-section 3"
        }
    },
    "Guide 2": {
        "gvar": "gvar GUID string" // Would have content structured like Guide 1
    },
    "Guide 3": {
        "svar": "name of svar" // Would have content structured like Guide 1
    },
    "Guide 4": {
        "uvar": "name of uvar" // Would have content structured like Guide 1
    }
}
```

### Guide 1

Under "Guide 1," you'll find two sections: "Section 1" and "Section 2."

#### Section 1

This section contains a singular paragraph that provides enough information to the topic that sub-sections are not necessary

#### Section 2

In "Section 2," you'll find more detailed content structured with multiple levels that require sub-sections.

- **Header**: This is the introductory paragraph for "Heading 2." It sets the stage for the subsequent sub-sections.
- **Sub-section 1**: Here, you'll find the contents related to sub-section 1.
- **Sub-section 2**: Here, you'll find the contents related to sub-section 2.
- **Sub-section 3**: Here, you'll find the contents related to sub-section 3.

### Guide 2

"Guide 2" introduces a different type of content structure. It includes a GUID string of a gvar (global variable). The content under "Guide 2" follows a similar pattern to "Guide 1," but with different content.

### Guide 3

"Guide 3" presents yet another variation. It includes the name of a svar (server variable). Like the previous titles, the content here is structured similarly to "Guide 1."

### Guide 4

"Guide 4" presents the last variation. It uses the name of a uvar (user variable). Like the previous titles, the content here is structured similarly to "Guide 1." This is only to be used within personal uvars as you cannot access another player's uvar.



## Accessing Guide Sections

To help you access information, you can query the guides located on your server at several levels. **Note:** Due to character limitations within Discord, you may need to provide a list number. Simply add that to the end of your query Ex. `!guide "Guide 1" 3`. Server staff can help avoid this by reducing the length of sections, and sub-sections. Server members can also be more specific in their queries (adding section and sub-section):

### General
Running `!guide` will bring up the guides and sections on your server. Using the json above, it would display the following (**s and #s will not show as it follows markdown formatting rules):
```md
## Guides

**Guide 1**
Section 1
Section 2

**Guide 2**

**Guide 3**
```

### Guide
Running `!guide [guide name]` will bring up the sections and the sub-sections within those sections. Using the json above, `!guide "Guide 1"` will display the following (**s and #s will not show as it follows markdown formatting rules)
```md
# Guide 1

## Section 1
Some singular paragraph or something

## Section 2
Header paragraph of Section 2

**Sub-section 1**
Contents of Sub-section 1

**Sub-section 2**
Contents of Sub-section 2

**Sub-section 3**
Contents of Sub-section 3
```

If you enter in a guide name that does not exist, the program will display an output similar to [General](#general).

### Section
Running `!guide [guide name] [section name]` will bring up the section and the content within the section. Using the json above `!guide "Guide 1" "Heading 2"` will display the following (**s and #s will not show as it follows markdown formatting rules):
```md
## Section 2
Header paragraph of Section 2

**Sub-section 1**
Contents of Sub-section 1

**Sub-section 2**
Contents of Sub-section 2

**Sub-section 3**
Contents of Sub-section 3
``` 

If you enter in a section name that does not exist, the program will display an output similar to [Guide](#guide)

### Sub-section
Running `!guide [guide name] [section name] [sub-section name]` will bring up the contents within a sub-section. Using the json above `!guide "Guide 1" "Heading 2" "Sub-section 1` will display the following (#s will not show as it follows markdown formatting rules):
```md
### Sub-section 1
Contents of Sub-section 1
```

If you enter in a sub-section name that does not exist, the program will display an output similar to [Section](#section)
