<h1>Guide Alias<img align="right" src="./images/subsection.png" width="100px"></h1>

Guide alias allows players and server staff to construct guides so that both players and staff do not have to rely on third-party services such as Google Docs, server staff, or other players on how to use various commands in Avrae.

This alias prioritizes the following variables from most important to least important: uvar -> svar -> gvar. Meaning, if you as a player need to add (or remove) more content to what is already in a svar, feel free to make a uvar as that will take precedence over a svar.

[Here](https://forms.gle/CF9mLq18HnjLrPUk7) is a google form with the purpose of collecting gvars so that guides can be shared and used by others. You do have to have a valid Google Account, this is to help cut down on potential spam. If your guide contains aliases from the workshop, please specify that in each of the guides.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hikxuci-aJQUST9h4R9on6vG-g7bvGmZ1P3EtraNdNA/edit?usp=sharing) is a link to the Public List containing all the GVARs that have been given to me.
