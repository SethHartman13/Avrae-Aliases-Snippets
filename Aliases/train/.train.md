<h1>Training Alias<img align="right" src="image.png" width="100px"></h1>

Training alias that allows players to train in various proficiencies. Allows for customization of training settings. This does take into account Fey Wanderer Ranger's ability to add their wisdom modifier to charisma ability checks. You can also manage what proficiencies players can learn and what ability score is used for each.

This does require cvar `subclass` to contain `Fey Wanderer`, otherwise the bonus will need to be manually done.

## Owner(s):
- Me (ShadowsStride)

## Current Plans:
- None

## Help:
`!train <prof_name> <-b> <adv/dis> <i>`

`prof_name`: If the training has not started prof_name is required. If continuing training you do not add it.

`-b`: Adds bonus to check.

`-i`: Ignores training cooldown (DO NOT USE EXCEPT WHEN TOLD BY AN ADMIN, the alias does keep track if this was used).

`adv`/`dis`: Applies advantage/disadvantage.

### Settings Dictionary Variable
This server variable that uses a json to customize the settings with training. This is not required, instead it will use default values. Here are the following settings:

- max_val: Integer that sets the max number of successes necessary - relevant ability score (i.e. 10 - CharismaMod (+3) = 7 successes) Default: 10

- disp_type: Shows what kind of counter type is shown, here are the following options:
  - None
  - "bubble"
  - "square"
  - "hex"
  - "star" (default)

- jack_of_trades: Says whether or not Jack of All Trades is used in the ability check.
  - 1: True (default)
  - 0: False

- thresholds: Determines how many successes you get based upon what you roll. By default, any roll below 10 constitutes as 0 successes, 10-19 is 1 success, and 20+ is 2 successes.

### Gaming Set Settings Dictionary
This server variable uses a json to determine what gaming sets can be learned and what ability scores are used for each. Within the `gaming_dict` svar, any gaming sets left out of the svar will become gaming sets that players are not allowed to learn through the training alias.

If you do not have the `gaming_dict` svar created, it will default to the below settings:

### Skill Settings Dictionary (README)
This server variable uses a json to determine what skills can be learned. Ability score to learn is the ability score associated with the skill. This is **NOT** RAW. I recommend setting the svar `skill_dict` to `{}` so that you do not have players gaining proficiency through this alias without your permission.

If you do not have the `skill_dict` svar created, it will be (by default) turned on
